**BICMEE 2020** gathers experts (including DARPA micro-BRAIN performers), who have interests in Bio-Inspired Computing for Miniaturization and Energy Efficiency. The meeting will focus on sharing progress and potential ideas for future work in this area. The meeting will be hosted at [Arizona State University](http://www.asu.edu/) with support from the [Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering](https://engineering.asu.edu/). Attendance is free, but due to limited seating, [**registration in advance**](http://bit.ly/bicmee2020registration) is required.

# Registration

Although attendance to BICMEE 2020 is free, [**registration in advance**](http://bit.ly/bicmee2020registration) is required because of space limitations for the workshop. If you wish to attend the workshop, register at: [http://bit.ly/bicmee2020registration](https://bit.ly/bicmee2020registration)

# Workshop Goals

1. Discuss research progress in the projects related to using bio-inspiration to develop new architectures for energy efficient miniaturized computing, with the goal of information sharing and productive feedback
1. Discuss potential future directions for this research, including the role that bio-inspired research may play in potential DARPA initiatives as well as technology transfer to industry
1. Identify potential synergies in our current and future research programs

# Schedule of events

The 1-day event takes place on February 28, 2020. Although no meals are provided, coffee and light refreshments will be provided at certain times during the day.

|             | OPENING REMARKS |
| ----------- | --------- |
| 08:30–09:00 | Sethuraman "Panch" Panchanathan, ASU EVP and Chief Research and Innovation Officer |

|             | PLENARY |
| ----------- | ------------------------ |
| 09:00–10:00 | Sean O'Donnell, Drexel University, Professor and Interim Department Head |
|             | _**Abstract:** Brain investment-constraints on growth and development are pervasive in animals, and comparative analyses suggest that brain miniaturization is limited in magnitude relative to most other body structures. I will illustrate some basic patterns of brain/body allometry using my own data from social wasps (Vespidae), and I will explore how major ecological shifts can break clade-typical brain/body allometries. Wasp body allometry patterns also suggest that the need to accommodate relatively large brains can impact body plans as smaller body sizes evolve within a lineage; the challenges of brain housing may even set lower limits on body size. I propose that brain/body allometry is an important overlooked factor in the evolutionary ecology of animal body size. I will then review some (bizarre) examples of brain-driven body plan changes in animal lineages pursuing extreme miniaturization, and I will discuss some of the physiological and cellular limits on the size reduction of brain themselves._ |

# Meeting Location

The workshop will take place in [Goldwater Center (GWC), Room 487](https://gis.m.asu.edu/asucampus/?query=CampusBuilding_7147_1%2CName%2CGoldwater%20Center%20for%20Science%20& Engineering=&extent=-12460266.7297%2C3951200.172%2C-12459908.7297%2C3951380.217%2C102100). Mid-morning and mid-afternoon coffee breaks will be provided on-site. Attendees are on their own for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, but restaurants are within walking distance.

## Parking on Campus

The Rural Road parking structure (see [map above](ASUmap.png)) is
a convenient location to park for workshop attendees. Take a ticket when
entering the garage and pay when exiting either at kiosks or at the
actual exit gates.

From the Rural Road parking structure:
* Walk west toward McAllister Ave.
* Walk north on McAlister
* Use crosswalk between Psychology Bldg and Biodesign Bldg B
* Walk west until encountering Goldwater on your right
